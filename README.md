## Welcome to VSD RISC-V CHIP TAPEOUT PROGRAM – Week 1

In Week 1, we focus on foundational concepts in RTL design and digital logic synthesis. The sessions are designed to provide both theoretical understanding and hands-on experience with open-source tools.

Key topics covered this week include:

≫ **Verilog RTL & Simulation:** Learn to model digital circuits and simulate their behavior efficiently.

≫ **Verification:** Use Icarus Verilog to compile designs and GTKWave to visualize simulation waveforms.

≫ **Logic Synthesis:** Convert RTL code to gate-level designs with Yosys, leveraging the SKY130 PDK for practical ASIC design experience.

≫ **Key Digital Design Concepts:**

Testbenches: Create environments to systematically verify your designs.

Timing Libraries: Understand standard cell timing and its impact on synthesis and performance.

Optimization Techniques: Apply strategies to improve area, speed, and power in combinational and sequential logic.

This week combines theory sessions and lab exercises, ensuring you gain hands-on experience with modern open-source VLSI design flows.
