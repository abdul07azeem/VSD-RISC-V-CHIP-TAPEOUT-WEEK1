## Welcome to VSD RISC-V CHIP TAPEOUT PROGRAM â€“ Week 1

In Week 1, we focus on foundational concepts in RTL design and digital logic synthesis. The sessions are designed to provide both theoretical understanding and hands-on experience with open-source tools.

Key topics covered this week include:

Verilog RTL & Simulation: Learn to model digital circuits and simulate their behavior efficiently.

Verification: Use Icarus Verilog to compile designs and GTKWave to visualize simulation waveforms.

Logic Synthesis: Convert RTL code to gate-level designs with Yosys, leveraging the SKY130 PDK for practical ASIC design experience.

Key Digital Design Concepts:

Testbenches: Create environments to systematically verify your designs.

Timing Libraries: Understand standard cell timing and its impact on synthesis and performance.

D Flip-Flop Coding Styles: Explore best practices for reliable sequential logic coding.

Optimization Techniques: Apply strategies to improve area, speed, and power in combinational and sequential logic.

This week combines theory sessions with hands-on labs, ensuring practical exposure to modern open-source VLSI design flows.

This week combines theory sessions and lab exercises, ensuring you gain hands-on experience with modern open-source VLSI design flows.



## Prerequisites
Week 1 is beginner-friendly but having the below prerequisites will make labs and synthesis exercises much smoother.
1. Digital Design Fundamentals:
-Basic understanding of digital logic gates (AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR).
-Knowledge of combinational and sequential circuits (multiplexers, adders, flip-flops, counters).

2. Verilog Basics
-Basic syntax and structure of Verilog HDL.
-Understanding of module definitions, ports, and signal types (wire, reg).
-Awareness of blocking vs non-blocking assignments in sequential logic.

3. Simulation and Verification Concepts
-Understanding of testbenches and their role in verifying digital designs.
-Familiarity with waveform analysis (how signals change over time).

4. Logic Synthesis Knowledge:
-Basic idea of converting RTL code into gate-level implementation.
-Awareness of timing constraints, standard cell libraries, and optimization goals (area, speed, power).

5. Software and Tools
-Basic knowledge of Linux command line for file navigation and running scripts.
-Ability to compile and run code using open-source tools like Icarus Verilog.
-Familiarity with Git/GitHub for version control is recommended but not mandatory.
