## Welcome to VSD RISC-V CHIP TAPEOUT PROGRAM – Week 1

In Week 1, we focus on foundational concepts in RTL design and digital logic synthesis. The sessions are designed to provide both theoretical understanding and hands-on experience with open-source tools.

Key topics covered this week include:

**Verilog RTL Design and Simulation** – Learn how to model digital logic circuits using Verilog and simulate their behavior.

**Verification using Icarus Verilog and GTKWave** – Explore how to compile Verilog designs with Icarus Verilog and visualize simulation results using the open-source waveform viewer GTKWave.

**Logic Synthesis with Yosys** – Understand how to synthesize RTL designs into gate-level representations using Yosys, along with practical exposure to the SKY130 PDK (Process Design Kit) Library for open-source ASIC design.

Key Digital Design Conccepts:
**Testbenches** – Create test environments to verify the correctness of your designs.
**Timing Libraries** – Understand the role of standard cell timing information in synthesis and timing analysis.
**D Flip-Flop Coding Styles** – Explore efficient coding practices for sequential elements to ensure reliable synthesis.
**Optimization Techniques** – Learn strategies for combinational and sequential logic optimization to improve area, speed, and power.

This week combines theory sessions and lab exercises, ensuring you gain hands-on experience with modern open-source VLSI design flows.



## Prerequisites
Week 1 is beginner-friendly but having the below prerequisites will make labs and synthesis exercises much smoother.
1. Digital Design Fundamentals:
-Basic understanding of digital logic gates (AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR).
-Knowledge of combinational and sequential circuits (multiplexers, adders, flip-flops, counters).

2. Verilog Basics
-Basic syntax and structure of Verilog HDL.
-Understanding of module definitions, ports, and signal types (wire, reg).
-Awareness of blocking vs non-blocking assignments in sequential logic.

3. Simulation and Verification Concepts
-Understanding of testbenches and their role in verifying digital designs.
-Familiarity with waveform analysis (how signals change over time).

4. Logic Synthesis Knowledge:
-Basic idea of converting RTL code into gate-level implementation.
-Awareness of timing constraints, standard cell libraries, and optimization goals (area, speed, power).

5. Software and Tools
-Basic knowledge of Linux command line for file navigation and running scripts.
-Ability to compile and run code using open-source tools like Icarus Verilog.
-Familiarity with Git/GitHub for version control is recommended but not mandatory.
