# Day 1: Introduction to Verilog RTL Design and Synthesis

Welcome to **Day 1** of the RISC-V CHIP TAPEOUT PROGRAM! Today, we will explore the fundamentals of **digital design, simulation and synthesis** using open-source tools.  

Below is a structured overview of today's topics. These topics can help you build strong foundation as a beginner in RTL Design:

1. [What is Design, Testbench and How a Simulator Works](#how-a-simulator-works)  
2. [Introduction to yosys](#designing-rtl-circuits)  
3. [Testbenches and Verification](#testbenches-and-verification)  
4. [Getting Started with Icarus Verilog and GTKWave](#getting-started-with-icarus-verilog-and-gtkwave)  
5. [Logic Synthesis with Yosys](#logic-synthesis-with-yosys)  
6. [Standard Cell Libraries & Logic Gate Flavors](#standard-cell-libraries--logic-gate-flavors)

## Design 

In VLSI **Design** refers to the process of defining the structure, behavior, and data flow of a digital system before it is implemented in hardware.

---

## TestBench

A testbench is a separate Verilog module used to verify the functionality of a design.
It applies inputs to the design and observes outputs over time.

---
Simulator

A testbench is a separate Verilog module used to verify the functionality of a design.
It applies inputs to the design and observes outputs over time.

## Getting Started with Icarus Verilog and GTKWave

- **Icarus Verilog**: An open-source Verilog compiler and simulator. It compiles your design and testbench to generate simulation outputs.  
- **GTKWave**: A waveform viewer used to **visualize signal changes over time**.  
Together, these tools allow you to **simulate and debug** your digital designs efficiently.

## Logic Synthesis with Yosys

**Logic synthesis** converts your high-level RTL code into a **gate-level implementation** using standard cells.  
**Yosys** is an open-source synthesis tool that reads Verilog code and produces a **netlist** suitable for simulation or ASIC/FPGA implementation. Synthesis ensures your design can be physically realized while meeting timing and area constraints.

## Standard Cell Libraries & Logic Gate Flavors

**Standard cell libraries** provide predefined logic gates (AND, OR, XOR, etc.) and sequential elements (D flip-flops, latches) with known **timing and electrical characteristics**.  
Different **flavors of logic gates** exist to optimize for **speed, area, or power**. These libraries are used during synthesis to map RTL logic to **actual physical cells** in an ASIC.
