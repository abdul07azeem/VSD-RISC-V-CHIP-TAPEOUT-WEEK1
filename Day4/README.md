# [Day 4: Gate Level Simulation, Blocking vs Non-Blocking Statements and Synthesis Simulation Mismatch.](Day4)

Welcome! In this session, we will explore the concept of **Gate Level Simulation(GLS)**, What are the major differences between **Blocking and Non-Blocking Statements**,How both types of Statements help in execution of logic,speed and efficiency of the design. Atlast we will Dive deep into labs relatd to 
**Synthesis-Simulation Mismatch.**
